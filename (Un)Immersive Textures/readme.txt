Hi, this is the beginning of my new series of mods, "(Un)Immersive Textures".
In this I will (probably) give many troops new skins and make the troops of different players more different.
In the future i will also add some animation changes and new animations for troops and lords.
Anyone who has suggestions or ideas can simply pm me on Discord. Feedback for impure animations etc. would also be nice!
Installation: Just copy the files in your games gm folder and let it overide. I would recommend doing a backup if you want to switch back.  



Special thanks to:
PodeCaradox for his Gm1 converter tool, which i mostly use and his support and help.
Steinhauer, who helped me with the crennels and interface files.
Wama 30 for the idea of the wooden textures.
And all the others who gave me ideas.
Firefly, who made such an amazing an longlasting game.
